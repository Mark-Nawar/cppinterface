Description: This package uses the c++ STL's sort and "algorithms"'s min_elemnt and max_elemnt. 
             This functions are local on C++ but by using Rcpp you can interface these functions to any R user.
             The Local c++ functions takes as an input a vector of doubles which is similar to a R vector.
